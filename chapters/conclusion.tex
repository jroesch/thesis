We propose to build an intelligent end-to-end deep learning compiler that can
automatically adapt high-level programs to run on new hardware devices automatically
with human level performance. We have already constructed a state of the art compiler
which outperforms all popular deep learning frameworks and can reliably support most
existing frameworks. We have continued to work on tighter integration with frameworks,
and better support for \relay's dynamic features. Automatic tensorizaton remains an unsolved
problem, that I plan on tackling in my final year. Although these pieces constitute a
complete solution there remains exciting work outside the scope of my thesis on
supporting new datatypes such as posits, new platforms with uTVM, a highly
parametric version of VTA, and much more.
