\section{Acknowledgements}

As I was finishing my thesis I began to think about writing the
    acknowledgements section, grateful for all the people who
    been along for the ride.
During this process it seems silly that we write such short preface to such a long
    document when the people, their time, energy, thoughtfulness, friendship,
    and roles seem so much more larger then the things that ended up in this
    document.
I will inevitably forget to thank some people,
    if you feel that you helped me you probably did, here it goes.

First of all thanks to my family who have always encouraged
    me to be my own thinker and let me be the rebel who
    always has to do it differently.
My undergraduate mentors who without I would probably be an unemployed
    jazz musician somewhere.
Murat Karaoraman who believed in me from day one even though looking
    back I didn't have much to show.
If you hadn't believed and bet in my potential I wouldn't be a computer scientist today.
To Ben Hardekopf and Tim Sherwood who taught me to do research
    and seek out interesting questions with a PL spin.
To my UCSB labmates who helped me grow into research and
    provided inspiration, wisdom, and friendship.
To my UCSB crew who helped me grow as a hacker, and
    not settle for less.

To UW PLSE, an amazing second home and group of people to
    go through graduate school.
The lab crew, and our times in the PLSE lab playing loud
    music, pranks, games, and banter.

To all my partners and friends during this time, who tolerated
    my obsession with work and shipping just one more 4k PR.
To Pavel who told me "doing verification sucks",
    I eventually got the message a few years later.
My co-founders at OctoML who brought me along for the ride
    even though I wasn't quite ready yet.
Thierry for grinding through the end of PhD together and
    fighting fires and growing up together.
Tianqi for diverting my life into an amazingly fun and
    different direction, thanks to a random email.
Jason, from reminding why betting on people is worth doing.
To all my co-workers at OctoML its been awesome to build
    a company with you and I appreciate the opportunity to
    learn and grow with such great people.

To Leo De Moura who was an amazing mentor for the start of
    my PhD and taught me things about research, life, and writings lots of code.
To Zachary L. Tatlock my devious advisor who was always there
    to pull the chair out from under me both literally and figuratively.
I learned how to run a group, mentor, invest in people, attempt
    balance in a busy life, and do big things.
To Xi Wang who was my co-advisor for part of my PhD
    and always someone who had wisdom and advice.
Finally to Eunice who has put up with me as I have struggled
    to have a social life, relationship, found and run a startup,
    and finish this little thing called a PhD on the side.
Thanks for being my late night editor, sounding board, and
    partner in crime.
You were always the taste tester for my real job
    of cooking way too often in the past few years.
This document should really be titled the PhD Pigout.
